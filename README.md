Features:

* Hide logo, buttons and user profile in navbar
* Replace the old Zhihu brand blue background with simple white color for navbar
* Remove the fixed effect of the navbar
* Hide (personally) unnecessary sidebar

## Why

I just don't like the big, blur navbar on Zhihu.com.

For me, it's simply a information resource, so I don't want to be disturbed by neither its redundant parts nor the SCREAMING design.

1. Clone the repository

 Â git clone https://github.com/ErythroME/simplify-zhihu-chrome-extension.git
